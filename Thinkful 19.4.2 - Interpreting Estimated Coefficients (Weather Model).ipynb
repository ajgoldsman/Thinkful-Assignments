The coefficients make sense in that we would expect humidity to have a large impact (in the positive direction) on apparenttemperature, since higher humidities tend to make people feel like the temperature is hotter. I was surprised by the positive sign on the windspeed coefficient, as I would have expected that higher windspeed would make people feel cooler, but it's a significantly smaller value than the coefficient for hmidity, so perhaps it just doesn't have much of an effect on the model."

Both the humidity and windspeed coefficients have decreased in value and switched from positive to negative. This is likely due to the fact that the combined humidity_windspeed feature is representing enough of the data that the humidity and windspeed individual features have become irrelevant or extraneous. The new coefficients indicate that when both humidity and windspeed increase, the temperature difference increases, but if only one of them increases and the other decreases, the temperature difference changes more with respect to the change in humidity than to the change in windspeed.
