    "There are many possible features to consider when modeling a coin toss. If we assume that it's a fair, perfectly balanced coin, we don't have to consider any potential skews in the probability of landing on one side or the other.  Features that we should take into consideration include:\n",
    "1. Height from which the coin falls.\n",
    "2. Lateral distance between the location of the coin flip and the spot it falls.\n",
    "3. Amount of rotational force applied to the coin in order to spin it.\n",
    "4. Elasticity of the surface on which the coin lands.\n",
    "5. Density/weight of the metal the coin is made from.\n",
    "6. Size of the coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take too many features into consideration, then you have to have more and more experimental trials, each time changing one of the features (as in the case of A/B Testing). So, for each additional feature, the number of experiments required goes up by at least a factor of 2. It saves time and resources to only consider the features that have the most significant effects on your experiment/model."

In data science, this is an example of the so-called recommendations systems. Read this nontechnical blog post of [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639) about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model."
